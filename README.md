This is a React app boilerplate.

Feel free to clone it and use it to start creating your app.
To use it, clone this repo and then complete all items in the [What's Next](#whats-next) section. 

What is this construct going to do? Who will find it useful?

# What's next:

- [ ] Change README contents - replace the contents of each section with the specifics of your app
- [ ] Update package.json
  - [ ] name
  - [ ] description
  - [ ] main
  - [ ] keywords 
  - [ ] repository
  - [ ] author
  - [ ] license
- [ ] Rename your construct's [class file](./lib/my_construct.ts) and [test](test/my_construct.test.ts) 
- [ ] Remove this section of the README, you're set

# This is a pre-release!

This is a quick first draft. All the options that will likely need to be added to accommodate a large
number of use-cases are still needed. If you'd like to make requests or help update this construct, please
open an [Issue](https://github.com/mbonig/cicd-spa-website/issues) or a [PR](https://github.com/mbonig/cicd-spa-website/pulls).

# React Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate of the React app. 

Feel free to clone it and use it to start creating your own app.


----

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
